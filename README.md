In this project, I chose to conduct a statistical analysis on the S&P 500 Index and 5 different companies from the U.S. In order for you to produce the same results as I did, please follow the instructions below:

1. Download the Zip file onto your computer from this GitHub page
2. Open and run the data_cleaning.R file on your local Rstudio or Rstudio.cloud to obtain the dataset
3. Open the paper.Rmd file in outputs/paper
4. Use the knit function in Rstudio to generate the pdf file of the report
